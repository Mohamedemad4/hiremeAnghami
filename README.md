# Services 

## Venator
Spawns and controls Selenium workers that download the songs.

#### API
- publish a message that looks like `{"song_url":"https://play.anghami.com/song/25770989"}` to queue `download_requests`
- consume  `downloaded_songs` and wait for a job completion message that should look like  `{"spng_state":"OK","song_id":"25770989","song_media_name":"Anghami_25770989.mp3"}` to be published
- the song should be located in the `SONG_DIR_PATH` under the name of the `song_media_name` param
